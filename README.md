# Bad Bank React App - MIT

<img src="./public/img/badbank-screeshot.png">

# Description

This application is the final project from Module 2 in the MIT X Pro Full Stack Developer Program that focused in the Front-End development using the React library and the Bootstrap framework for styling. In the development of this application I used React hooks, React-Router and context. This app is deployed in a AWS bucket that you can access here: <a href="http://daniel-gaviriabankingapplication.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com">Bad Bank React Application</a>

To run this application simply clone it into your local machine or download the .zip file to get the source code.
